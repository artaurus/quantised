<h2>Wave-Particle Duality</h2>
<p>
While others were still grasping the concept of wave-particle duality in light, Louis de Broglie extended it to matter. He explained the selective existence of stationary states with <i>matter waves</i>. If the electron was considered as a wave in an atom, it could never radiate. Furthermore, a wave in orbit would have to merge into itself after each revolution. States are therefore quantised, as the orbit circumference must be a multiple of the wavelength

where <i>r</i> is the orbit radius.

Without affecting the equality between wave and particle velocities, de Broglie postulated that equations [1] and [2] hold for matter as well. Substituting equation [2] in equation [5] results in equation [4],
<span class='equation'><i>rp = nh / 2&pi;</i><span>[8]</span></span>
since <i>l = rp</i> is the classical definition of angular momentum. Thus, de Broglie's matter waves formed the basis of Bohr's postulates.
<br><br>
Subsequently, Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger introduced the <i>wavefunction</i>, denoted by <i>&Psi;</i>, as a mathematical wave associated with matter particles. Given a particle's potential energy, Schr&ouml;dinger's equation computes the wavefunction, which is generally complex (includes both real and imaginary numbers). Squaring the wavefunction ensures that it is real and positive, which Max Born interpreted as a probability distribution
<span class='equation'><i>P<sub>dist</sub> = |&Psi;|<sup>2</sup></i><span>[9]</span></span>
of the particle's position in coordinate space, i.e. the wavefunction determines where the particle can be found.

<br>
An absurd yet interesting phenomenon explained by this probabilistic interpretation is quantum tunnelling; a particle may pass through a barrier because the wavefunction exists on the other side, albeit with a reduced amplitude. Within the barrier, the wavefunction decays exponentially, but depending on the barrier's dimensions, it can escape to the other side before reaching zero.

Bohr's atomic model was restructured using the wavefunction. For an electron in an atom, the wavefunction is split into a radial part and an angular part. The former is quantised into states labelled by <i>n</i>, similar to the stationary states. The latter is quantised into states called <i>spherical harmonics</i>, labelled by <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>, since two angular coordinates are required for a sphere. Certain conditions are imposed on these state labels
<span class='equation'><i>n = 1, 2, 3, ...</i><span></span></span>
<span class='equation'><i>l = 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1</i><span>[10]</span></span>
<span class='equation'><i>m = - l, ..., - 1, 0, 1, ..., l</i><span></span></span>
giving them the name <i>quantum numbers</i>; they parametrise the wavefunction as <i>&Psi;<sub>nlm</sub></i>. As before, the energy levels are determined by <i>n</i> alone, generating the same atomic spectra. Each wavefunction encloses a cloud-like <i>orbital</i>, illustrating where the electron can be found. Bohr's old-fashioned orbits were just the positions at which the radial wavefunction peaked, i.e. the most probable distances of the electron from the nucleus. It is rather unsatisfying that wave mechanics reduces the atom to a fuzzy mess.
