<h2>Transformation Theory</h2>

  Waves possess a property called <i>superposition</i>, which is similar to addition. If <i>&Psi;<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>&Psi;<sub>2</sub></i> are wavefunctions that satisfy the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, then so does <i>&alpha;&Psi;<sub>1</sub> + &beta;&Psi;<sub>2</sub></i>, where <i title='alpha'>&alpha;</i> and <i title='beta'>&beta;</i> are scalars (real or complex numbers). Paul Dirac observed the resemblance between wave superposition and <i>vector</i> algebra.

  Vectors are elements of a vector space, and have as many components as the dimensions of that space. For example, a vector <i>|v&gt;</i> in an <i>f</i>-dimensional space will have <i>f</i> components.
  <span class='equation'><i>|v&gt; = (v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, ..., v<sub>f</sub>)</i><span>[11]</span></span>
  Addition of two vectors <i>|v&gt;</i> and <i>|w&gt;</i>
  <span class='equation'><i>|v&gt; + |w&gt; = (v<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub> + w<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>f</sub> + w<sub>f</sub>)</i><span>[12]</span></span>
  and multiplication of a vector <i>|v&gt;</i> with a scalar <i>a</i>
  <span class='equation'><i>a|v&gt; = (av<sub>1</sub>, av<sub>2</sub>, ..., av<sub>f</sub>)</i><span>[13]</span></span>
  generate vectors that exist within the same space as the original vectors. It can be extrapolated such that, if <i>|v&gt;</i> and <i>|w&gt;</i> are vectors of a space, then <i>a|v&gt; + b|w&gt;</i> is a vector belonging to the same space, where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are scalars.

  Hence, Dirac represented the wavefunction as components of a vector <i>|&Psi;&gt;</i>, called the <i>state vector</i>. Since a wave consists of an infinite number of points, the state vector must correspondingly have an infinite number of components, thus residing in an abstract infinite-dimensional vector space called the <i>Hilbert space</i>.

  <i>Operators</i> transform vectors. A vector's components form a one-dimensional array of numbers; an operator's components occupy a two-dimensional array. An operator <i>O</i> in an <i>f</i>-dimensional space has <i>f <sup>2</sup></i> components.
  <span class='equation'><i>O = (O<sub>11</sub>, O<sub>12</sub>, ..., O<sub>1f</sub>,<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;O<sub>21</sub>, O<sub>22</sub>, ..., O<sub>2f</sub>,<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;...<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;O<sub>f1</sub>, O<sub>f2</sub>, ..., O<sub>ff</sub>)</i><span>[14]</span></span>
  Werner Heisenberg formulated an alternate mathematical framework in which vectors and operators are represented by column and square matrices respectively, reducing vector algebra to matrix algebra. Chronologically, Heisenberg's matrices preceded Schr&ouml;dinger's waves, but its abstract arrangement of numbers lends a less visual introduction to the subject. It is necessary to realise that the components of a vector or an operator are not unique; the same vector or operator will have different components in different coordinate systems, analogous to an object having different names in different languages. As such, vectors and operators will subsequently be used without reference to their components. An operator <i>O</i> acting on a vector <i>|v&gt;</i> transforms it into a vector <i>|w&gt;</i>.
  <span class='equation'><i>O |v&gt; = |w&gt;</i><span>[15]</span></span>
  Of special interest is the eigenvalue equation, in which an operator simply scales a vector.
  <span class='equation'><i>O |v&gt; = &phi; |v&gt;</i><span>[16]</span></span>
  <i>&phi;</i> is a scalar called the <i>eigenvalue</i> and <i>|v&gt;</i> is called the <i>eigenvector</i> (or <i>eigenstate</i>) of operator <i>O</i>. There are as many eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator as there are dimensions in the vector space. Dynamical variables such as position <i>q</i> and momentum <i>p</i> are represented by operators called <i>observables</i>. If the state vector is an eigenstate of the position observable <i>Q</i>, its corresponding eigenvalue is the position <i>q</i> of the particle.
  <span class='equation'><i>Q |&Psi;&gt; = q |&Psi;&gt;</i><span>[17]</span></span>
  Similarly, if the state vector is an eigenstate of the momentum observable <i>P</i>, its corresponding eigenvalue is the momentum <i>p</i> of the particle.
  <span class='equation'><i>P |&Psi;&gt; = p |&Psi;&gt;</i><span>[18]</span></span>
  In the case that the state vector is not an eigenstate, the dynamical variables are calculated as weighted averages, or <i>expectation values</i>, over the probability distribution <i>|&Psi;|<sup>2</sup></i>.
  <br><br>
  Perhaps the most important operator is the <i>Hamiltonian</i>. It is a description of the system's energies: kinetic <i>T</i> plus potential <i>V</i>, associated with momentum <i>P</i> and position <i>Q</i> respectively. Schr&ouml;dinger's equation (the time-independent version) may now be introduced in the form of an eigenvalue equation.
  <span class='equation'><i>H |&Psi;&gt; = E |&Psi;&gt;</i><span>[19]</span></span>
  where <i>H = T (P) + V (Q)</i> is the Hamiltonian, and the eigenvalues are the possible energies <i>E</i> of the particle. On solving the Hamiltonian of an electron in an atom, the eigenvalues equal the energy levels of the stationary states, and the components of the eigenstates, i.e. the wavefunctions, equal <i>&Psi;<sub>nlm</sub></i>. Conventionally, the state vector is abbreviated as per the quantum numbers, <i>|nlm&gt;</i>. Since the energy levels are determined only by <i>n</i>, multiple eigenstates have the same energy. For example, <i>|2 0 0&gt;</i>, <i>|2 1 -1&gt;</i>, <i>|2 1 0&gt;</i>, and <i>|2 1 1&gt;</i> all possess the energy <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> (refer equation [10] to confirm the possible states for <i>n = 2</i>). Multiple eigenvectors sharing the same eigenvalue is termed <i>degeneracy</i>.

  Dynamical behaviour of the wavefunction is thus imitated by transformations of the state vector. Aptly named, Dirac's transformation theory encompasses Schr&ouml;dinger's waves and Heisenberg's matrices.
