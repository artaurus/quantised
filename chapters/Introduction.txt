Light is a wave. In particular, a wave of propagating electric and magnetic fields, i.e. an electromagnetic wave. Every object radiates electromagnetic waves with a spectrum solely dependent on its temperature. At the turn of the 20th century, Max Planck derived a formula which suited the experimentally measured spectra, but in doing so, violated an established theorem of physics. He assumed that the exchange of energy between light and matter is not continuous, but in the form of discrete packets called <i>quanta</i>. Energy of a quanta <i>E</i> is proportional to the electromagnetic wave frequency <i>&nu;</i>. The simple equation

introduced the fundamental Planck constant <i>h</i>. Albert Einstein radically proposed that this quantisation was inherent in the nature of light itself, as particles called <i>photons</i>. Equation [1], known as the Planck-Einstein relation, specifies the energy of a photon. When merged with the theory of relativity, the photon necessarily has zero mass. Energy of a massless particle is given by <i>E = pc</i>, where <i>p</i> is the momentum of the particle and <i>c</i> is the speed of light. Combining the Planck-Einstein relation with the relativistic energy equation results in a photon momentum
<span class='equation'><i>p = h / &lambda;</i><span>[2]</span></span>
where <i>&lambda; = c / &nu;</i> is the wavelength of the wave. This was the first instance of wave-particle duality; <i>E</i> and <i>p</i> are properties of a particle, while <i>&nu;</i> and <i>&lambda;</i> are properties of a wave.

Opposition to the existence of photons was nullified via two experiments regarding photon-electron collisions. First was the photoelectric effect, in which incident light ejects electrons from a surface. Triggering the phenomena requires that the photon energy exceed the minimum value by which the electron is bound. As per the Planck-Einstein relation, this correlates to a threshold frequency of light, contrary to wave theory predictions of a threshold intensity. Second was the Compton effect, in which the wavelength of light increases as it deflects off an electron, mimicking a billiards-like collision. A momentum transfer from the photon to the electron factored into equation [2] derives this result.

Having deciphered light-matter interactions, Niels Bohr targeted matter itself. Analogous to the solar system, his famous model of the atom consisted of negatively-charged electrons orbiting a nucleus of positively-charged protons. However, classical electromagnetism predicts that an electron in orbit will radiate its energy, causing it to spiral into the nucleus. To overcome this hurdle, he postulated the existence of orbits with certain energies in which the electron does not radiate, termed <i>stationary states</i>, and labelled by a positive integer <i>n</i>. An electron transitions between two states separated by energy <i>&Delta;E</i>, through the absorption or radiation of a photon whose energy equals their difference.

This generates a characteristic set of frequencies associated with the energy levels of a chemical element, known as <i>atomic spectra</i>. Bohr further postulated that the angular momentum <i>L</i> of the electron is quantised in <i>h</i>,
<span class='equation'><i>L = nh / 2&pi;</i><span>[4]</span></span>
after remarkably observing the similarity in their units. Subsequent implementation of classical particle motion allowed him to extract the atomic spectra of hydrogen and helium. Excellent agreement with experimental data superseded a deeper enquiry into the postulated non-radiative nature of these states.
